Since I was ten-years-old I was fascinated by the magic Open Source world, but it also scared me 'cause I see in this world un-available for me, for my limited skills. So, over the years I made many things, except to contribute to this world, but today I found the brave to spread something that I wrote and put it on *Drupal Community*.
