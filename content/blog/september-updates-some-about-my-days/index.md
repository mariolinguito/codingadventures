## 1. Deployed Codsletter, how are going?

A week ago I deployed and launched Codsletter, a platform that automatizes the newsletter sending for your blog.

I tried to make everything automatic because I don't want to weigh down my blog with some third-party component or plug-in, and I don't want a comment system because I don't want to answer all comments because of work and other personal things.

So I invented Codsletter, I put the form on my blog (you can see it on the home page) and every 7 days, if I wrote 3 articles (at least), the system sends automatically a newsletter to all my subscribers!

Of course, I can edit this configuration and you too can subscribe to your blog on the platform and begin a new newsletter.

Again: I published the application on Reddit and others, and some users gave me some advice to improve the software on the tech side and not. Then, I have some improvements to implement into the software like:

* A new landing page,
* The possibility to edit the SMTP server (because you probably want to send the newsletter from your e-mail server),
* The possibility to edit the template of the newsletter before sending it,
* Today I hosted the software on Heroku, but I want to buy a domain and hosting, so I can manage everything myself as continuous integration (like Heroku do), SSL certificate, and others;

The software is completely open-source because I believe in the free and open-source community, and you can contribute with it (you will find it on GitHub).

Regarding the stats, I have some subscribers to my newsletter, but fewer users on the software itself. I hope will be better :-)

## 2. Some symbols for my personality

Recently, at work, I followed a particular course where the introduction was quietly intriguing: the teacher asked us to draw some symbols that express our personalities. You can guess that this is not a simple operation, because you cannot express whole into some symbols, you need an entire universe for this, but we tried anyway.

So, there are some symbols I draw and some words about it.

### The angry symbol

The first symbol that I draw was the angry symbol. I draw this because, unfortunately, I'm not a patient person in some circumstances, and when I'm starting to fire, I'm firing at all!

I don't think that this is a good thing, but if you want to see the positive side of this element, I will say that I'm angry only for the important things (banality).

### The sun and people

The sun means prevalently that I'm happy with and around people, and this is not simple today, because we are controlled by social media. I especially love talk face-to-face, avoiding a screen.

This is so simple, in the end.

### The calendar

The calendar because I'm a routine person, so I'm constantly on things, especially on the work! Tendentially, I'm not statically, but I love to describe myself as a far-sighted person about almost everything.

But, as I said at the top of this article, you cannot describe all aspects of your character using some symbol, or using some words; a person is a jumble of things and thinks that we cannot know!

## 3. Kubernetes, I think that I will learn this

In the last period, I begin to learn Kubernetes because of a complete course organized by my company. I find it really interesting and I started to make my own server (using, of course, Linux and in particular Ubuntu Microk8s) so I can do some exercises following the documentation.

Yes, I can say that the documentation is perfect, you can learn a lot about K8S using the documentation and following chapters.

Regarding this, I want to make some projects running on Kubernetes and in particular some Drupal projects (but K8S is perfect for everything).

This is the end, I hope you liked it; if yes, you can subscribe to my newsletter (that I made with Codsletter :-P)
