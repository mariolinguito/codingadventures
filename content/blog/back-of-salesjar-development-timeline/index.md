description: Salesjar has its layout builder, come to take a look!

Salesjar has a back-end side, of course, and I developed it in Java using maybe its most famous framework: Springboot. But it is so simple, that it could be written in any language without any forms of difficulty.

Today I want to show you a single part, but according to me, the most important of the application: the Layout Builder (Drupal, are you?) 

I think a lot about this, and I want to make something that is simple to use for the normal users, not so simple to seems banal, but not so hard to seems impossible to approach! So I took a look at other CMS or website builder, like Drupal, WordPress, Wix, Adobe AEM, and so on, and I tried to get the best from them. 

So, there are some schemas that I want to show, the first is a classic flow that a registered user can do, and the second is a database schema to show how this is possible.
