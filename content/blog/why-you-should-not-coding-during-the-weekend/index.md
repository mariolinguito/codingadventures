Scrolling social-media feeds, from Facebook to Twitter, I see some (many of some) posts about how is good to coding during the night, weekend, son' birthday, and so on... but, is it really like this?! 

I'm not sure about, first because you can be productive on work and side-projects also if you do not open your computer during the weekend; and second, because you can trip your mind if the only things that you see for hours are lines of code.

We are too much permeated by the idea that the laziness period is bad and you can achieve your goals only if you work hard and tirelessly, this is because movies, self-help books, social media and so on.
