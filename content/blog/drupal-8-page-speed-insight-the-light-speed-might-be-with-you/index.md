But our desire is always to see that value at least more than 60-70% for Desktop and 50-60% for mobile (if you consider that more traffic today came from mobile devices). I want to start with this: with Drupal, it is difficult to have high values because (of course) it is heavy and it is a substrate that you use behind your application!
