As title, in the last years Drupal and React made a strong bond and there are so many articles and tutorials about how to integrate React into Drupal or how to create a React application and use Drupal as a back-end system or like!

Yes, you don't have to use React necessarily, because every other front-end framework works like a charm: Angular, Vue, etc. 

Why I chose React? Because I'm doing some projects in React+Drupal, and because I want to learn something different from the back-end or CMS technology, but always related to Drupal (my today obsession :P)
