## Introduction

As title, in the last years Drupal and React made a strong bond and there are so many articles and tutorials about how to integrate React into Drupal or how to create a React application and use Drupal as a back-end system or like! Yes, you don't have to use React necessarily, because every other front-end framework works like a charm: Angular, Vue, etc. 

But, why I chose React? Because I'm doing some projects in React+Drupal, and because I want to learn something different from the back-end or CMS technology, but always related to Drupal (my today obsession :P)

My curiosity was attracted by how many things you can do with a great and powerful system based on, so I'm going to integrate a SPA (Single Page Application, see Wikipedia for the definition) into my administration pages, give it a specific route and give to the authenticated users the possibility to interact with it.

For this purpose, I chose a well-know Javascript library.
