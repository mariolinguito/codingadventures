It comes a time when someone has to choose on what to spend energy, so it is inevitable to shutdown something or breaks another. So, this is a list of projects that I want to shut down, that I don't want to dedicate my time and myself because some reasons (that I listed in this post). Plus, I want to say in this post what is my future plan. 

PS. Okay, this is a little bit annoying for someone but I started this blog for myself mainly, and this is why I'm not so obsessive on analytics or others. I publish articles sometimes, so if someone found this helpful: good; otherwise: good. As I said in other articles, this is more a logbook than other.
