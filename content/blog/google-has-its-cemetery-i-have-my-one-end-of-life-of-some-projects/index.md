It comes a time when someone has to choose on what to spend energy, so it is inevitable to shutdown something or breaks another. So, this is a list of projects that I want to shut down, that I don't want to dedicate my time and myself because some reasons (that I listed in this post). Plus, I want to say in this post what is my future plan. 

PS. Okay, this is a little bit annoying for someone but I started this blog for myself mainly, and this is why I'm not so obsessive on analytics or others. I publish articles sometimes, so if someone found this helpful: good; otherwise: good.

## The exclusion

### 1. Codsletter

After the last release of this software, I'm not planning any other releases just because it works. I mean, it works for what it was supposed to work for. If you read the blog post that I wrote about this you will notice that I created Codsletter for me, for the fact that I didn't want to put a comment system or something like on my blog, or again third-parties software. 

So, it works well for the simple thing that it should to do, and I'm not planned to upgrade it.

## The cemetery

### 1. Salesjar

### 2. Sturiorum

## The future plan

### 1. Kubernetes and related

### 2. Drupal

### 3. Blogging, blogging, blogging

### 4. Game development (?)
