## The problem

The problem I found is so simple to result trivial, I work prevalently with **Microsoft Teams**, and in most cases, I'm in calling someone to solve some problem, and often I'm facing to send a snippet of code through the chat. 

But... Teams are good for more things, but not for coding, in fact when I send some piece of code to someone and my co-worker paste this into him code happen that there are more special chars and other garbage that Teams put in it. It is frustrating to clean that code before using it, so I made a snippet-sender for Visual Studio Code. 

### Why Visual Studio Code?

Simply because it is my favourite editor and it is the most used in my working space.
