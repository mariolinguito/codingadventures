As I explain in the title of this blog post when I finish a project, I immediately feel satisfied. From the designing to writing code you can learn a lot of things, but with the introduction of the new framework, like **Django**, **Laraver**, **Spring** and new ultra-CMS such as **Drupal 9**, most of the complicated things that before of this you made manually, today you can make it automatically. 

This is not bad news, because, for example, in a professional background or context, the velocity to produce a new project and deploy it is essential. However, this is radically reduced by the enormous amount of frameworks and similar on the market, that fundamentally makes the same thing, so a new (and sometimes expert) developer can lose much time to choose the best instruments instead of using them to make things done. 

**This is bad news, but not the worst.** 

The worst news is that many of these developers had lost the capacity of thinking on a solution, and lost the curiosity and the brave to discuss the solution of another developer that believe better than theirs. So they hide behind the phrase: "If someone had spent much time to make this, why I should make it better?"

Behind this phrase, I admit it, sometimes also I hide. You can see my last project, in which I use Java Springboot and Angular, to make my life easier :P 

However, I suggest to all developer, programmers (yes, it is not the same thing), computer scientists, and like, to learn to think and solve a problem with intelligence and learn how to code a solution to a problem, independently of programming language, framework or other... Because the thing that makes you a good developer, instead of a developer, is the way of the thinking.
