#### Simply...

I know you **don't have time** to make a merketplace or e-commerce from scratch. In fact, some steps to follow to create a new website, or especially e-commerce, require more time than you think, for example: 

1. If you don't have hard skills to make it, you need to search for a web developer that make the dirty things for you, 
2. If you have the skills to make a website, you need to choose a tech stack to use, like LAMP or MEAN,
3. The third step is about the infrastructure you need to use to make all things work correctly, 
4. And finally, you can start your project;

The project can require 6-7 months, but, at the end of the project, maybe you don't have the same enthusiasm of the beginning or you wasted so much time that your competitors have already made thousands of sales.

#### In this life, you haven't so much time. For this, Salejar is born.
