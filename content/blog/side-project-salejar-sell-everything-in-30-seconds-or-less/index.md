#### Simply...

I know you **don't have time** to make a merketplace or e-commerce from scratch. In fact, some steps to follow to create a new website, or especially e-commerce, require more time than you think, for example: 

1. If you don't have hard skills to make it, you need to search for a web developer that make the dirty things for you, 
2. If you have the skills to make a website, you need to choose a tech stack to use, like *LAMP* or *MEAN*,
3. The third step is about the infrastructure you need to use to make all things work correctly, 
4. And finally, you can start your project;

The project can require **6-7 months**, but, at the end of the project, maybe you don't have the same enthusiasm of the beginning or you wasted so much time that your competitors have already made thousands of sales.

#### In this life, you haven't so much time. For this, Salejar is born.

The main features that I want to make for the first release are: 

* The possibility to make one or more stores in 30 seconds or less, so you can start your business as soon as possible, 
* The possibility to customize your store with some pre-installed themes, each one with their colours and background, 
* The possibility to drag-and-drop some elements on the blank page, like sliders or products list, and others (initially there will be only a few elements, of course), 
* The possibility to access to your admin and manage your stores, with some CRUD features: 

  * Create a product with name, description, price and one image, 
  * Update a product, 
  * Delete a product, 
  * Clone a product; 
* The possibility to access to your dashboard and manage sales and other information like the customers addresses and so on; 

For now, that's all.
